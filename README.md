# Crystal Collector Game
    
## Here's how the app works:
    
* There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

* The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

* When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

* The game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.

* When they do click one, it updates the player's score counter.

* The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

* The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

* The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

* When the game begins again, the player see's a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

## Why this app is useful:

* The game is not only fun to play but also sharpens the brain.

* Anybody with basic math knowledge can play this game.
